# Alethenyx INTELLIGENT CORPA Compendium (Alpha v0.9)

Alethenyx provides high-fidelity, high-entropy empirical data anchors developed for internal LLM alignment and proprietary research. 

## Technical Integrity
This repository will serve as the cryptographic verification layer for the ICORPA dataset. We provide these protocols to allow potential partners to verify data provenance and ensure zero-tamper delivery.

### COMPENDIUM STATE (Updated: 14 Feb 2026)
* **Verified Corpus:** 350,000+ Synchronized Anchors
* **Growth Vector:** Active Expansion / Human-in-the-Loop Validation
* **Data Integrity:** SHA-256 Collateralized
* **Availability:** Air-Gapped / Cold Storage

## Why INTELLIGENT CORPA?
* **High-Entropy Anchors:** Designed for deep-layer model alignment.
* **Audit-Ready Provenance:** Every shard is cryptographically signed.
* **Research Exclusivity:** Alethenyx data is not sourced from common-crawl or open-web public dumps.

## Security & Governance
* **Steganographic Watermarking:** Every data shard is uniquely watermarked. This allows Alethenyx to trace data usage, ensuring total asset protection.
* **Full Auditability:** Our data is fully auditable for compliance. Each entry includes comprehensive metadata, allowing for the verification of source integrity and ethical data lineage. 

## Strategic Partnership
This corpus was developed for internal AI development. We are making a limited number of seats available to select partners to fund the continued growth of our research and the expansion of the Alethenyx vault.
